			<h3>Technology</h3>
			<p>
				Thanks to some incredible technology available on the internet to people like myself, in many cases, for free, fnstraj can exist for free too. I wanted to highlight the ones I choose, because I'm very proud of the quality they offer and to be using their services.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<h4>Node.js</h4>
					<p>Node.js is the application platform the fnstraj backend runs on it. It's quickly becoming the most powerful platform on the web, and after spending over 9 months in developing the backend, I can see why. I've read that it's bad to use Node.js for processing types of programs - I can't agree. 
				</li><li>
					<h4>CouchDB</h4>
					<p>I've always had a developer-crush on CouchDB. It's an amazing database that treats data like Javascript objects, which I really enjoy working with to start with. CouchDB powers the flights store and the queue engine. I choose Cloudant to run fnstraj's databases.
				</li><li>
					<h4>Heroku</h4>
					<p>Heroku is the hosting platform for the backend of fnstraj - it's really great, even in its free plan! Deployments are super easy and quick in most cases (for what it's doing).
				</li><li>
					<h4>NOAA GrADS</h4>
					<p>Easily the most painful data in the WORLD to access, except straight binary maybe. This is where all the wind data comes from, and what always breaks fnstraj. It's vital to running successful reports with any degree of accuracy.

					<h4>async.js</h4>

					<h4>gunmail</h4>
